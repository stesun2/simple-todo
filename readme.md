# Simple Todo Page
We now have all the basic tools of the front end at our disposal. Let's put them to work by creating a To-Do List application.

## Steps:
* Create your HTML/CSS/JS files
* Display a list of items that you need to do. Use local storage to get/remove/add these items.
* Create a form at the bottom of the list to add more things to your todo list
* Create the ability to check off things from your todo list. When you check things off, make sure that has a ~~strikethrough~~ so that you know what you've already done. This will probably alter the data structure you have in local storage.
* Style it! We will be learning [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) tomorrow so you can jump ahead if you'd like but other than that, you can use basic CSS
