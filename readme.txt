Simple Todo Page

We now have all the basic tools of the front end at our disposal. Let's put them to work by creating a To-Do List application.
Steps:

    -Create your HTML/CSS/JS files
    -Display a list of items that you need to do. Use local storage to get/remove/add these items.
    -Create a form at the bottom of the list to add more things to your todo list
    -Create the ability to check off things from your todo list. When you check things off, make sure that has a strikethrough so that you know what you've already done. This will probably alter the data structure you have in local storage.
    -Style it! Look into using Bootstrap for styling in addition to vanilla css.
